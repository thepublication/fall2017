    <h3>ESSAY</h3>
    
    <p>
        1. This is a “narcissism of small differences” situation. Especially for us,
on the East Coast, emphasizing origins in the Midwest or South is a means
of differentation. Also consider recent western/folk trends in music: Alex
G’s Rocket or Big Thief or Weyes Blood. (very different from hipster folk
like Fleet Foxes in sincerity or something maybe just generational) It may
also be an attempt to align oneself with the working class for post_Trump
communism-is-cool reasons. <br />
2. Micromemes: since memes turn over so fucking
quickly these days, they are going to morph into a dual-sided system. The
current over-arching process of a meme growing to the point where it
gets overused (something we all feel/sense--I don’t know of any formula
for this) and then fading away will remain, but it will be accompanied more
and more by what I call “micromemes”. They’re nothing new, and I’m not
saying they are. Memes will just circulate more within more closed groups
parallel to some reaching typical meme class. Even friends will share memes among them more and more. This duality already exists of course,
but it will tip the scales in degree. <br />
3. No more wallowing! so out. Instead, a veneer of health will take over
even if you’re not, because, honestly, it’s easier to just pretend you’re
healthy and have fun. <br />
4.America itself is so OUT wwe didn’t even have to write it. Stop referring
to solidarity with ONLY America with thinking of ONLY AMERICA. This
out list item is actually a command ?
Anyway, a recent example is “Pray for Florida” and triviliazing recent disasters when Puerto Rico and other marginzalized areas were more seriously hit.<br />
5. FLorida-speaking of Florida itself is out. It enjoyed an ironic time in the
sun thanks to situations like The Bath Salts Incident and “Florida Man...”
meme format. No more!
